# Clippy configuration for CEL Lua project
# See https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/configuration.html for all options

# Allowed lints for FFI code
# Since this project has significant FFI components, we allow some clippy lints
# that are commonly triggered by FFI patterns but are necessary for the API

# Maximum cyclomatic complexity before clippy warns
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 25

# Maximum number of lines for a function before clippy warns
too-many-lines-threshold = 150

# Maximum number of arguments for a function before clippy warns
too-many-arguments-threshold = 8

# Minimum number of enum variants before clippy suggests using Box
enum-variant-size-threshold = 300

# Allow missing safety docs for FFI functions (can be overridden per function)
# Note: This is handled in code with #[allow(clippy::missing_safety_doc)] where appropriate
